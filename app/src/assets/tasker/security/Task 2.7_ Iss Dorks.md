\*\* Task group: Information Security \*\*

# Context

Information Disclosure happens every day. Google is a very nice search engine for finding information which shouldn’t be public. Google uses ‘dorks’ for making your search query more efficient, e.g. _site:_, _inurl:_, _filetype:_. E.g. a google dork for finding passwords in excel files use: `"login: *" "password: *" filetype: xls`

Hint: use the Google Hacking Database (GHDB): [https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/)
