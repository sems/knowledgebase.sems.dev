# Context

Sometimes you need to debug your HTTP(S) network traffic.

An often used tool for analyzing HTTP(S) (and other Internet) traffic is Wireshark ([http://www.wireshark.org](http://www.wireshark.org)). NOTE: by sniffing the network possibly the Confidentially is in danger.

Two other tools come in handy when testing for HTTP connections: `telnet` (or `netcat`) for HTTP and `openssl` for HTTPS. HTTP is a ASCII based protocol, which you can easily play yourself.

# Deliverables

-   Show screenshots/screencast of a HTTP connection to your test host
-   Show screenshots/screencast of a HTTPS connection to your personal bank

# Task

1.  Download a Kali VirtualBox VM ([https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/))
2.  Download the Windesheim BBT VM from the elo.
3.  Start your Kali VM
4.  Start the Windesheim BBT VM
    -   Obtain your IP number via `$ ip address`
5.  Kali: Run
    
    ```
     $ telnet IP_OF_BBT 80
    ```
    
    Now you can 'speak' HTTP (send the HTTP request optionally with headers)
    
    ```
     GET / HTTP/1.0
     [ENTER]
    ```
    
    You should see the server responding with the contents of the index.html file.
6.  Kali: using telnet for HTTPS connections is very cumbersome (you have to type binary). Therefore we use `openssl` for debugging a TLS connection:
    
    ```
     $ openssl s_client -connect IP_OF_BBT:443
    ```
    
    You should see the TLS cryptography exchange Again now you can 'speak' HTTP (send the HTTP request optionally with headers)
    
    ```
     GET / HTTP/1.0
     [ENTER]
    ```
    
    You should see the server responding with the contents of the index.html file.
7.  Kali: Start Wireshark and start sniffing on the host\_only interface
8.  Kali: Start a browser and surf with to your Windesheim BBT VM
    -   Analyse the packages: show the response
9.  Kali: Surf to your personal bank
    -   Analyse the packages: which encryption algorithm is used?
