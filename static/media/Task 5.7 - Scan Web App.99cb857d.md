**Task group: vulnerability scanning**

# Context

Automated scanning for vulnerabilities. Determining by hand if you developed a secure application is quite a burden. OWASP has a project called ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) which you can use to test your application for vulnerabilities. When developing your web application (pages en REST API) you can use ZAP in the test pipeline, before you release a new version.

ZAP has some nice introduction video's here: [https://www.zaproxy.org/zap-in-ten/](https://www.zaproxy.org/zap-in-ten/)

# Deliverables

-   Show a report of the ZAP findings of scanning the hackshop (BBT VM)
-   Show countermeasures: give an overview of what should be fixed.

# Task

1.  Start the BBT VM
2.  Start the Kali VM
3.  Kali: Start ZAP
4.  Do a vulnerability scan with ZAP on the hackshop.
